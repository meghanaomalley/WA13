<p> Hi, I'm going to be comparing two things I don't know much about- Basketball and Doigecoin. But, what is similiar is how they are both talked about topics in our world today. This investigation is to remind you that correlation does not equal causation. Or for this matter there may not even any correlation at all.</p>

<p>P2- Five players are on the court at a time in the game of baseketball. I checked out the top 5 players on the LA Clipper. I tooked at a dataset that predicts how good they will be for the season. The term of the metric is called RAPTOR. It can range anywhere from 12 to -12. It should be mentioned that returing players have an advatage with this rating system. Also, just because a player may have a negative score doesn't mean they are bad at basketball- they are professional after all- but maybe not as good as others. </p>

<p>p3- Doigecoin is something I know nothing about. I think Doige is a dog and it's some type of made up currency. </p>

<p>p4- If we look at the two together, it is evident that there is no connection at all - but the data visulizations are very similar in shape. They both have rise and falls. And if I were to rearrange the basketball players in a differnt order then the connection woulf look even more similar. But in no way so they actually influence eachother.</p>

<p>p5- So, there you have it a comparrision between two things I knew nothing about. This information seem irrelevant to me now but maybe the topics will rise in popularity and who knows when these things will come up. </p>
